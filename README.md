# rust-weechat

**rust-weechat** is a high level wrapper of the [Weechat][] plugin API in [Rust][].

[Weechat]: https://weechat.org/
[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/

## Project structure

The project consists of three different crates.

- **weechat** - High level and idiomatic Rust library that allows to easily
  write [Weechat][] plugins.
- **weechat-macro** - Procedural macro implementations that allow you to define
  C entry functions that a Weechat plugin needs to define.
- **weechat-sys** - Auto-generated low level bindings to the Weechat plugin API.

## Status

The library is in an beta state, things that are implemented generally work some
breaking changes might still be introduced. A lot of the less used plugin APIs
aren't yet implemented.
